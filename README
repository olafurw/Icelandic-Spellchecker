This is a simple (and currently a very naive) spellchecker setup. It is designed for the Icelandic language.

It uses the Play Framework for the web interface.

It uses a MySQL database to check for the words. 
If you're pulling at this stage, then it might take a little work to get it going. 
Since the database I'm using is not something I can open source, but the code is.

The table should be called 'ordmyndir' and the row with the words should be called 'ord'

A lot of work is needed! Like teaching it Icelandic.
